* Training on fashion_train_val3.prototxt:
	a) three VGG_M_2048 are trained separately;
	b) only a single SoftmaxLoss layer is used;
	c) training batch size 64;
	d) learning rate for CNNs (10e-4), and for metric net (10e-2), kept for 100000 iters (~ 11.85 epochs);
	e) epoch size for training dataset (270000*2 = 540000), and for testing dataset (67500*2 = 135000);
	f) still working on Polyvore_small;
	g) momentum 0.9, weight_decay 0.0005;
	h) fashion_predict3_15260.caffemodel is saved (~ 6 hours);
	i) accuracy on training dataset (~0.70), on testing dataset (~0.654);
